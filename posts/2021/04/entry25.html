									<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
									<p>Finding a domain and domain registrar can be a real pain. If you go and search domain registrar on google you will get spammed with ads from companies like GoDaddy, SquareSpace, Wix, and many more. Now I'm not saying any of those companies are bad or not something that I would recommend. I will say if you want to do something like my current website being mostly a static page with only some blogs or photos and have some time to put a small amount of work in I would not recommend any of the sites I stated earlier. The big sites like SquareSpace and Wix provide a very good service to a lot of people. The main features of websites like Wix is their website builder and provide domain registration as a side business. This gives a bit of an issue because they can charge a huge amount if you just want a domain and not use their other services. This leads me into what I did to find a service that doesn't charge a ton for what I wanted.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Search for the registrar</h3>
									<p>After spending way too long searching around for best prices for the domain I wanted I finally found some useful information. I heard from somewhere the price for a domain is set at a minimum price from <a href=”https://www.icann.org/get-started”>ICANN</a> (the company that overlooks many of the registrars of .com and .orgs) which sets the price for what a registrar will charge me. After hearing that I started to look into websites that focused solely on providing domains and nothing else. After focusing my search I found two services that fit my requirements, <a href="https://domains.google/">Google Domains</a> and <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Name Cheap</a>. I didn't look much into Name Cheap mostly because I took a look into what Google Domains offered and the price they charged was very reasonable for me and fit all my needs plus some more.</p>
