Tactics

# General notes on defaults and tactics

-   The purpose of a default is to take map control and set yourself up
    for the round endgame

-   Mid vs. “extremity” defaults

    -   Mid default (1-3-1): Usually 3 people take mid and establish
        strong map control

    -   Extremity default (1-1-3): Instead of 3 people going mid, 3
        people go to A or B (the extremities of the map)

-   If your 3 people on an extremity default get a pick, explode off of
    it instantly and your two 1-1 people become lurkers

# Notes on Overpass tactics

-   Most teams use an A-side default (3-1-1)

# A Execute

# B Execute

# Push B

-   To push monster, throw [<u>this molotov</u>](#barrels) to clear out
    barrels and then throw [<u>this flash</u>](#b-site) twice

    -   Your teammates can swing out wide through monster and you have a
        great entry because barrels is clear

-   You can take short by [<u>throwing this
    molotov</u>](#construction-1) and pushing water

# 3-1-1 Default

-   1 person goes B

    -   [<u>Throw this molly</u>](#construction-1) to prevent a push
        through construction

    -   You can either watch for pushes passively by standing
        [<u>here</u>](#passive-b)

    -   Or make your way through short, being sure to clear out boost

-   1 person goes connector

    -   To clear connector, first [<u>throw this
        molly</u>](#connector-molotov-1)

    -   Then clear out the rest of the angles in connector (there are a
        lot of them)

-   3 people go A

    -   [<u>Smoke off bathrooms</u>](#bathrooms-from-fountain) and
        [<u>molly</u> <u>divider</u>](#divider) (will clear out any
        AWPers), this will give safe access to get to long or let you
        take mid

    -   Take bathrooms control from long OR from mid

        -   If you want to take bathrooms control from mid, clear
            connector and [<u>throw this flash to clear
            short</u>](#short-from-underpass-entrance)

    -   Bathrooms control is the endgame for this default. There are two
        main options from here.

        -   You could clear out short with an AWPer and go A

        -   Or make your way through connector and go B. [<u>Throw this
            flash to take water</u>](#water-from-connector).

# 1-1-3 Default

-   3 people go B

    -   Two people can get control of water ([<u>throw this
        molotov</u>](#construction-1)) and then join up with the
        person connector. From there, you can take bathrooms control
        using the 3 people in connector and your default becomes a
        1-3-1

# 2-2-1 Default

-   1 person goes B

    -   Same as 3-1-1 default

-   2 people go connector

    -   One person [<u>throws this molly</u>](#connector-molotov-1)

    -   The other person [<u>throws this
        molly</u>](#connector-molotov-2)

    -   This is a safer way of taking connector control. All angles
        below stairs are cleared with these two molotovs.

-   2 people go A

    -   Same as 3-1-1 default, just with one less person
