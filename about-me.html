									<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
									<p>I am a Computer Science student at Colorado State University graduating December 2021. I will be graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in computer science with a concentration in networks and security. I enjoy spending time tinkering on projects and learning more about the world of cyber security. I also enjoy a good bourbon (My personal favorite is <a href="https://www.blaumbros.com/blaum-bourbon">Blaum Bros Straight Bourbon Whiskey</a>)</p>

									<h3 class="major">Past Work Projects and Learning</h3>
									<p>As I finish up my college career I have collected a good amount of experience and knowledge. I spent the last two summers working at a small cyber security focused managed service provider (email me if you would like to know more). During that time I spent many hours learning and growing. I took a number of courses and got some training in popular security products such as PaloAlto Next Generation Firewall, Trend Micro security suite, Symantec, and many others. I also worked closely with the CTO to ensure I learned as much as possible. We spent some time setting up lab networks to study and better understand the software we sold. This experience was very beneficial to my understanding of the professional world in terms of IT and Information Security.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Personal Projects</h3>
									<p>During my time at school I have taken a number of classes that give me a well rounded understanding of programming, security, operating systems, and more. I have taken a few information security classes where we learned the basics of how an attack happens and how to prevent these basic attacks. I have also taken a few development classes learning how to code in C, C++, Python, Java, Javascript, and some minor HTML. Beyond school I have worked a number of personal projects revolving around self hosted services. I have tested and set up a personal <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> server, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> media server, local DHCP (<a href="https://www.isc.org/dhcp/">isc-dhcp-server</a>) and DNS (<a href="https://www.isc.org/bind/">bind9</a> and <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">PiHole</a>) with fallback for both services. I have also spent a fair amount of time working in <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a>, <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html">ESXi</a>, and some minor <a href="https://xcp-ng.org/">XCP-ng</a>. Doing all my personal projects has given me a good amount of experience and knowledge with linux, mac, and windows in different levels of understanding.</p>
